<h2>About Me!</h2>

<li>
Mimi is a 23 year old lady from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She has just graduated 
from University of Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Arts degree in International 
Relations. Mimi has always had a passion about traveling as she used to go on 
study abroad trips during her college years. However, now that she has graduated 
she has decided to take a year off and travel around the world. Her first place 
to visit is Uganda. Her very good friend is from there and recommended her to 
go visit. She can use this application to learn more about Uganda, as it links 
her to other sites where she can book her plane ticket, compare hotel and 
airline prices and also signup for tours dates and locations when she arrives 
in Uganda.
