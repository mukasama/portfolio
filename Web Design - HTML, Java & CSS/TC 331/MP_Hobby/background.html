<h2>Description!</h2>

<ul>
<li>
One of my hobbies is traveling. Ever since, I was young I used to travel all over and never wanted to leave the plane once we returned back home. I started traveling at the age of 7 and the first time that I ever went on the plane alone was when I had just turned 10. So far I have been to over 10 countries in 4 different continents. Traveling is very important to be because every time I go to a different place there is always something special and better than the last place I had gone too. I also love learning and interacting with different cultures as I do experience the music, food and people I meet. The other reason why I love traveling is I can buy things cheaper that I would get it somewhere else. We usually travel as a family and experience the adventures together.

<h2>Problem/ Topic To  Explore!</h2>

When I first came to the Michigan State University for school, people would always ask me where I am from because my accent was different from what they were used to hearing. I told them I am from Uganda and not many people knew where it was or heard about it. This application is designed for those who are traveling to a different country or just want to learn more about at country but don’t really know much about it. This application enables the user to learn about the language, culture, music and food that is from that country. I decided to start off with one country (Uganda) since there isn’t a lot of information about it and because I am from there and know how everything works it’s a lot easier for me to show this.
