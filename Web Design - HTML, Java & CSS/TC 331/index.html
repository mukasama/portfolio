    <div id="text">
    <p> I am an International student from Uganda, who is a senior at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Media and Information with a minor in Information Technology. I moved to the United State back in 2010, although I have always had family members in different states of the country like California, New York and Florida. I discovered my love for technology at a very young age, as I always asked my parents to by me the latest electronics that came out. As I grew older the more I become attracted to technology and then discovering my love for computers. Not only could I play games on computers but, I could also do research and my homework, talk to my friends over seas and so much more. This was why I decided to major in this field. I have been involved in a lot of Information technology work as I am the Director of Information Technology at Associated Students of Michigan State University a studentâ€™s government at MSU. However, I do love having fun too, as I am always up for new challenges and always excited once I solve them. I enjoy traveling and have been to quite a number of countries. I also love playing sports most especially rugby. </p>
