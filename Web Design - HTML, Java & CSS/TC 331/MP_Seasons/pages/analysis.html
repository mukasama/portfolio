<div class="imageText">When I drew the image of my house. I really wanted to incorporate three of the most important design principles. These are the rule of thirds, balance and proportion. The rule of thirds covers a lot of structures that many artists use when drawing a picture. For example my season’s image is not centered. I drew it from an angle so that it looks and shows all the areas around my house such as the car garage and the separate room on the right that we use as a guest house. I also trimmed unrecognizable objects removing the unneeded space as I focused on the main parts of the house since I really couldn’t draw the backyard of the house all in one picture. Along with balance in the image I added proportion to it. This is shown by the different matching colors used as they aren’t so confusing and if someone was to look at the image they would tell the difference between the roof and the floor for example. I used balance to show different heights for example not everything is on the same level and some trees are taller than others since not all trees grow at once.</div>
