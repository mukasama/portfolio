<div class="imageText">Irrespective of not having the seasons in Uganda, in my family this is the season filled with so much happiness and delight. Fall is indeed my favorite season. My family has various events at our house including my own birthday since my house is large enough with a brick wall around it for privacy. During this season we strive to help the needy or poor whenever we have time. This is the time my family comes together through the community help projects, environment projects like tree planting and neighborhood support. Coupled with the exposure to the different parts of the world, my family continuously desires to be exposed to new culture as we do plan events and invite people into our home. Whenever someone walks into our backyard they are so amused with how large it is. This is the season that excites me because it includes the beginning of the long cold winter nights and as well the birth of Jesus. A season whereby there are heavy rains. The location of my room is great as I can see the sunrise and set as well as stare and smell the fresh air outside as I view the beautiful leaves being blown off the trees in my backyard.</div>
