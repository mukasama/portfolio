of the ball. Training Balls are made to last longer as<br /> they 
are used more than match balls. They also have a hydratec 
barrier in <br />their construction, which helps to repel water 
and dirt which helps to  maintain<br /> the quality and shape of
the balls. All balls require inflation upon delivery.</li>
